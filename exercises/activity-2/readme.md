# **Group Activity 2: Defining a Character Variable in Rust**

## **Instructions:**

1. **Form a group** with 2-3 members and decide on a **group number**.

2. **Create a new Rust project** together using Cargo:
   - One member can initialize the project by running:
     ```bash
     cargo new group_X_character_variable
     ```
     *(Replace `X` with your group number.)*

3. **Collaborate on the Code:**
   - In the `src/main.rs` file, work together to:
     - Define a character variable.
     - Assign the variable the first letter of your first name.

4. **Task Breakdown:**
   - Assign tasks to group members, such as defining the character variable or printing its value.
   - Ensure everyone contributes to writing and reviewing the code.

5. **Test the Program:**
   - Once the program is written, run it using:
     ```bash
     cargo run
     ```
   - Check that the program correctly prints the assigned character.

6. **Discuss and Troubleshoot Together:**
   - If there are any issues, troubleshoot as a group, review each other's code, and ensure the program runs smoothly.

7. **Present Your Solution:**
   - As a group, present the code and explain how each member contributed to the project.
   - Discuss the significance of character variables in Rust.

## **Objective:**
Work collaboratively to write and execute a Rust program that defines a character variable and assigns it the first letter of your first name.
