# **Group Activity 3: Finding Maximum and Minimum Numbers in Rust**

## **Instructions:**

1. **Form a group** with 2-3 members and decide on a **group number**.

2. **Create a new Rust project** together using Cargo:
   - One member can initialize the project by running:
     ```bash
     cargo new group_X_max_min
     ```
     *(Replace `X` with your group number.)*

3. **Collaborate on the Code:**
   - In the `src/main.rs` file, work together to:
     - Implement two functions:
       - `find_maximum(numbers: &[i32]) -> i32`: This function should take an array of integers and return the maximum value.
       - `find_minimum(numbers: &[i32]) -> i32`: This function should take an array of integers and return the minimum value.
     - In the `main` function, call these functions with an example array and print the results.

4. **Task Breakdown:**
   - Assign tasks to group members, such as writing the `find_maximum` function, the `find_minimum` function, or testing the functions with various arrays.
   - Ensure everyone contributes to writing and reviewing the code.

5. **Test the Program:**
   - Once the program is written, run it using:
     ```bash
     cargo run
     ```
   - Check that the program correctly prints the maximum and minimum values from the provided array.

6. **Discuss and Troubleshoot Together:**
   - If there are any issues, troubleshoot as a group, review each other's code, and ensure the program runs smoothly.

7. **Submission Instructions:**
   - Create a folder named `group_X` (replace `X` with your group number) in the `submission` directory of the [Rust Basics Web3 Cebu Polkadot repository](https://github.com/armlynobinguar/rust-basics-web3-cebu-polkadot.git).
   - Inside your group folder, include:
     - The Rust project folder.
     - A `README.md` file explaining your approach and any relevant details.
   - Push your changes to the repository.

8. **Present Your Solution:**
   - As a group, present the code and explain how each member contributed to the project.
   - Discuss the significance of finding maximum and minimum values in arrays.

## **Objective:**
Work collaboratively to write and execute a Rust program that implements functions to find the maximum and minimum numbers in an array, and submit your work to the designated repository.
